  "why": "The mental cost of re-entry exceeds the perceived value. Every dormant project has an invisible wall made of forgotten context. This dissolves that wall. Transforms relationship to unfinished work — projects become resumable instead of dead.",
  "flow": "1. Armaan mentions stale project in conversation\n2. Jess detects dormancy + intent\n3. Jess runs: node scripts/context.js <project-name>\n4. Script queries MC tasks + memory files\n5. Returns plain text dump\n6. Jess synthesizes into coherent summary\n7. Delivers via Telegram",
  "implementation": "**MVP Spec (buildable in <2 hours):**\n\n**Trigger:** Jess calls script manually when detecting dormant project mentions\n\n**Data Sources (v1):**\n- Mission Control API — tasks matching project name (title, notes, tags)\n- Memory files — grep memory/ for project mentions\n\n**Output Format:**\n```\nPROJECT: <name>\nLAST MC ACTIVITY: <date>\n\nTASKS:\n- [status] Task title (updated: date)\n  Notes: ...\n\nMEMORY MENTIONS:\n- memory/2025-01-15.md: \"Started working on X...\"\n```\n\n**Explicitly OUT (v1):**\n- Git integration\n- Calendar integration\n- Auto-triggering/keyword detection\n- Staleness scoring\n- Any UI beyond CLI\n- Proactive notifications\n\n**Build estimate:** 50-100 lines, one script",
  "ux": "**Core Principles (must preserve):**\n\n1. **Reactive, not commanded** — If he has to remember to type /resurrect, we failed. Jess detects dormancy + intent. No new habit required.\n\n2. **Synthesis, not links** — Not \"here is your notes file.\" The transformation is: \"Last touched 3 weeks ago. You were implementing calendar sync. Task MC-47 still in-progress. Last commit said WIP: auth flow broken. You were blocked on refresh token handling.\"\n\n3. **Zero maintenance** — He never feeds this system. It feeds on existing data. The moment it requires tending, it dies.",
