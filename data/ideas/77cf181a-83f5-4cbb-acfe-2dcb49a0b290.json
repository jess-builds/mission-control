  "why": "When studying for exams, need to find everywhere a concept was mentioned across multiple lectures. Currently would have to manually search each transcript.",
  "flow": "Global search bar → type topic → see results from all lectures with timestamps and snippets → click to jump to that point in any recording.",
  "implementation": "Build search index of all transcripts. Could use vector embeddings for semantic search or simple full-text for v1. Results grouped by lecture with timestamp links.",
  "ux": "Search box in lecture dashboard header. As you type, dropdown shows matching results across all courses/lectures. Click result → opens that recording at the relevant timestamp.",
