  "why": "Armaan already has a preferred warm vibe preset. Automating it means he never has to think about it — the room just feels right at the right time.",
  "flow": "Could integrate with morning brief (bright start) and wind-down routines. Natural extension of existing Tuya integration.",
  "implementation": "Add 3 cron jobs at 9am (bright), 7pm (cozy), 10pm (dim). Use existing scripts/tuya.js with preset command. Consider sun-based timing via weather API for sunrise/sunset.",
  "ux": "Zero interaction — it just works. Maybe a quick Telegram notification when mode changes, or silent by default.",
