  "why": "Students need quick review materials. Currently transcripts are raw text with no structure for studying. Summary cards would extract the actionable knowledge.",
  "flow": "After recording completes → AI processes transcript → generates card with: main concepts, definitions, key quotes, 3-5 quiz questions. Card appears in recording detail view.",
  "implementation": "Add post-processing step after transcription. Use Claude to extract structured data. Store as JSON alongside transcript. New UI component for card display.",
  "ux": "User finishes recording → sees \"Generating study card...\" → card appears with tabs: Concepts, Definitions, Quiz. Can export as flashcards or PDF.",
