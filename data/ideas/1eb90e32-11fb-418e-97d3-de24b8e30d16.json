  "why": "If we build this right, it solves a real pain point for every Clawdbot user. Memory is the #1 requested feature. Being first to market with a quality solution = reputation + potential revenue.",
  "flow": "Fits perfectly with Clawdbot ecosystem. Users install via clawdhub, configure API keys, and get smart memory. Armaan could even make tutorial content about building it.",
  "implementation": "Phase 1: Build for ourselves. Phase 2: Abstract away Armaan-specific stuff. Phase 3: Package as skill with install script. Phase 4: Submit to ClawdHub with docs.",
  "ux": "Install via one command. Auto-configure with existing models. Works transparently — users just notice Clawdbot remembers things better. Maybe a /memory command to inspect what it knows.",
