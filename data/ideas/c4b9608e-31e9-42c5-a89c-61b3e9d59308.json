  "why": "Armaan wants to build in public but struggles with consistency. The friction is not the work — it is turning work into content. Ship Log captures what he ships daily and instantly generates shareable posts. Over time, it becomes a living portfolio of everything he has built.",
  "flow": "Already building things daily. This fits naturally at the end of a work session — log what you shipped, get a ready-to-post update. No extra effort, just capture what already happened.",
  "implementation": "Next.js + Tailwind + localStorage (or SQLite). Claude API for post generation. MVP: input form, AI-generated tweet + LinkedIn versions, copy buttons, local persistence, history list. Future: git integration, shipping streaks, direct posting, public changelog export.",
  "ux": "Open Ship Log → type what you shipped → click generate → get tweet + LinkedIn post → copy and post. Under 30 seconds. History view shows everything you have shipped over time.",
