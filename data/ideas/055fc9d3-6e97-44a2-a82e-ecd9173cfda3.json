  "why": "Armaan wants to build in public but struggles with consistency. The friction is not creating content — it is turning existing work INTO content. Ghost Content removes that friction entirely by running passively on work he already does.",
  "flow": "Zero behavior change required. Keep using Mission Control (which he already does). Ghost Content monitors task completions and commits in background. When interesting work happens, AI generates a post. Drafts accumulate. Optional weekly review. Auto-publish when trust is earned.",
  "implementation": "Mission Control background service (not new app). Hooks into MC task API + git commits. AI transformation layer with quality bar — only genuinely interesting work becomes content. Drafts-first architecture, auto-publish ready. Optional weekly review queue.",
  "ux": "Armaan does nothing. Works normally. Drafts appear in a queue he can check weekly (or ignore). When ready, flips switch to auto-publish. His build-in-public presence grows passively.",
