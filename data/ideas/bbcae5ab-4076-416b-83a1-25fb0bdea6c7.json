  "why": "Passive note-taking leads to forgetting. Spaced repetition is proven to improve long-term retention. Automatically scheduling reviews of key concepts would make studying more effective.",
  "flow": "After generating study cards, key concepts enter spaced repetition queue. Dashboard shows what needs review today. As user reviews, algorithm adjusts intervals.",
  "implementation": "Store review metadata per concept (next review date, interval, ease factor). Daily cron or login check surfaces due items. Simple SM-2 algorithm for v1.",
  "ux": "\"Review\" section in dashboard. Shows cards due today. User marks \"Got it\" or \"Forgot\" → adjusts future schedule. Optional push notifications for review reminders.",
