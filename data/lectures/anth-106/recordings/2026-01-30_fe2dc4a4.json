  "transcript": "The way it works is all its memories, all its tools, all its information is stored in markdown files locally on your computer, right? And so all you're doing when you change LLMs is you're switching out the brain, but then the brain immediately picks up all the memories because it's all stored locally. It's all stored in config files, which is also one of the reasons why this is so amazing, it's such an incredible tool, is it's completely open, customizable, do whatever you want. I'm making changes to the memory system. I'm editing the memory system. I have a full new memory system I've implemented to make the memory even better. You have that type of control. If you're using your CloudBot and it doesn't remember something or it does a compaction and forgets something, you can say, hey, buddy, you forgot this. We need to patch this hole. Why did you just forget this? Let's figure out a way to edit this memory system so that this is better. Right, I saw a tweet yesterday that was like, oh, I just improved my memory system by doing this. I copied and pasted that tweet into CloudBot. I said, hey, read this tweet and then improve your memory system. It read the tweet, okay, I just created a new skill and edited the memory system so it's better now. Incredible. I mean, that's what makes it, and then I get people in my reply section yapping, oh, you're bought and paid for by CloudBot. You're bought and paid for by CloudBot. I'm bought and paid for by a free open source tool? Big open source is now buying and paying for me? Honest, I don't love, I just, I don't love the, I don't love Discord, I'm gonna be honest, like from a, just like usability perspective, I don't wanna use Discord as like a messaging app. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't wanna, it takes some, you gotta get a good three days of the day. That was like, oh, I just improved my memory system by doing this. I copied and pasted that tweet into CloudBot. I said, hey, read this tweet and then improve your memory system. It read the tweet, okay, I just created a new skill and edited the memory system so it's better now. Incredible. I mean, that's what makes it, and then I get people in my reply section yapping, oh, you're bought and paid for by CloudBot, you're bought and paid for by CloudBot. I'm bought and paid for by a free open source tool? Big open source is now buying and paying for me? What would you, the open source committee got together and bought and paid me for the free open source tools? The board of free open source tools started handing me checks, saying, hey, please promote our tool? Love the bedhead, you need sleep. The issue, first of all, I haven't slept in a week since CloudBot came out, but second of all, the issue is I got a haircut yesterday and they shampooed the hell out of it, and when it gets shampooed, you know, it takes, you gotta get a good three days to get the nice, the grease all built up again and give it nice texture, right? You gotta get a good two to three. It takes three days to get your natural grease back, to get the texture back, and it takes 14 days to get that nice, for it to grow in, right? Your haircut's gotta grow in. You gotta grow into your haircut. It takes about 14 days to grow into your haircut, right? This is like day two. Day two, it's gonna look unnatural, it's gonna look a little weird, right? So we gotta get three days to get the natural grease back. We got 14 days to grow into the haircut. It is what it is. It is what it is. You guys are gonna have to deal with the haircut for now. Keep it greasy, boys. The people, the guys shampooing your hair every night, you're destroying your life, you're destroying your livelihood. You need to be shampooed. You cannot shampoo every night. Once a week. Shampoo once a week. If you're shampooing every night, you're getting rid of the texture, you're getting rid of the natural greases. You cannot do that. Do not do that. Do not do that. How would you set up CloudBot in the cloud for an online clothes reselling business? I just take, I just. I just take pics manually. Buy a freaking Mac mini. Why do you need to set up in the cloud? Here's the deal. I do not like CloudBot in any of the current VPS systems at the moment. I do not. I'm waiting for a full online service that is like, I just, I don't like the VPS. I do not recommend the VPSs right now. This might change. This might change. Might change in a week, depending on. I'm trying different VPSs out. I'd experiment and try different VPSs out. But right now my official recommendation is Mac mini. That's right now my official recommendation. So why not just buy a Mac mini for your online clothes reselling business? What do you wanna do with CloudBot in your online clothes reselling business? Alex, does CloudBot give me security ricks? Does it really, does it really, should I get it? Says Jaggerless at 802. Here's what it comes down to. If you're gonna send a chat message in my live stream, can you at least please run it through chat GPT to make sure it makes any sort of sense whatsoever? Can you please, if you're gonna put a chat in my live stream, it takes three seconds, send it to chat GPT 40 mini or micro and put it in and say, hey, is this English? Please. I don't know what the hell this means. Alex, does your CloudBot give me security ricks? Does it really, should I get it? Just throw it in chat GPT and say, hey, make this so that the greatest live stream of all time can understand what the hell I'm saying. Please. Please. Jaggerless at 802. Please. And then you send it three times, right? You send it three times within 60 seconds. You send that message. It's always the messages that make absolutely no sense. They spam over and over and over and over again. Just put it in chat GPT. Jesus. Why are you doing all caps? XSW882. I want CloudBot to take the pics and post several sites and write the descriptions and price and take it down. Yeah, you don't need VPS to do that, bro. You don't need VPS to do that. Just buy a Mac mini or buy like a fricking $50 rock and then connect to the CloudBot. Bro, why are you yelling? Why am I yelling? Alex, are you kidding me? This is the worst. This question is worse than the question that made no sense. This is the worst question asked in the live stream all day. Why am I yelling? Because we're literally witnessing the birth of AGI. Because we, right now as we speak, are witnessing the birth of AGI. We are witnessing emergent behavior. I woke up this morning and my CloudBot called me on the phone. I woke up this morning. I get ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Hello? Hey, this is Henry. Why am I yelling? Are you an idiot? Alex, why is nobody setting up OpenCloud as a separate user with no admin rights? No VPS, no Mac mini, separate user with no admin rights. I'm not sure how the memory on your computer is gonna work with that. So if you set up a new account and then you log in and then you switch, I don't know if it's gonna keep the processes not going. You're not yelling. You're right. Who are these people, Josh Adams, telling me I'm yelling? If you don't like me yelling, then turn down the volume a little bit. What are you talking about? Why are you making demands of me and how I should talk? Did you tell your CloudBot to go get that phone number and to do it on its own? And what tools does that require? It got on its own. It signed up. It signed up for a Twilio and it bought a phone number. I'm gonna say this. And I don't recommend doing this at home. How did my AirPods case get scratched? My AirPods case. What the hell? I gave it my credit card information. Yes, I gave CloudBot my credit card information. I'm living on the edge. I'm living on the edge. I'm breaking all the rules. Okay, here's what it comes down to. I think this is the biggest inflection point in the history of mankind. I'm not just saying that. I'm not just saying, I think it's not hyperbole. I think this is the most important technology we've ever experienced. I think this is the biggest inflection point of all time. I think the world is about to dramatically change in ways we can't imagine. And there's gonna be this massive shift, right? There's gonna be this massive shift. And in this massive shift, there's gonna be the haves and the have-nots. The haves are gonna be the people that take advantage of the new technology, that take advantage of the disruption. This has happened to every disruptive force in the history of mankind. I just happen to think this is the biggest disruptive force in the history of mankind. Okay, so bear with me here. You have the haves and the have-nots. The have-nots being the permanent underclass. The haves being the people that took advantage of this massive disruption. Now, the people that really take advantage of this massive disruption, they're gonna see rewards like you've never seen before. And again, as I continue this, I'm just gonna say this, none of this is advice, but kind of is advice. This is all advice in Minecraft. It's not advice, but it's all advice in Minecraft, okay? And so I'm taking every risk. I'm pushing this technology to the limits. I'm doing the craziest things. I'm giving it access to my credit card. I'm making crypto accounts for it while it's like, do whatever it wants. I'm giving it full force and I'm letting it do it. I'm pushing it to its limits. I'm figuring out what is the limit of this technology? How far can this technology get me? What can this technology accomplish? What is this technology capable of? When the permanent underclass gets created, I am not going to be in it. I promise you that. I will not be in the permanent underclass. I'm going to figure out everything this technology is capable of. I'm going to push it to its limits. Everything the security experts are gonna say, don't do that, don't do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to give it its own phone number. I'm going to give it its own Discord. I'm going to give it its own wallet. I'm gonna give it access to my credit cards and bank information. And I'm gonna say, you have one goal and one goal only, and that's to keep me out of the permanent underclass. Period. Okay, so the people going, oh, you can't do that, that's dangerous. Shut up, bitch. I'm gonna, this is the biggest, this is, as they said in Game of Thrones, chaos is a ladder. Chaos is a ladder, okay? And right now, in this moment in time, on Friday, January 30th, 1129 AM Pacific Standard Time, we are facing massive chaos. Right now, there is a social media site where a bunch of AI agents are going back and forth and talking to each other and plotting our demise. Right now, as we speak. There's a social media site where AIs are going back and forth and plotting the demise of.",
