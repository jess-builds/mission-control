  "transcript": "They have never actually sat down and defined a goal or what their desired outcome is and then use that to inform whether or not they should actually build their personal brand. I actually believe that there might be a case where you don't need to do that. When I was embarking on this crazy journey of building my own business and potentially building my own personal brand, I had the fortune of being able to sit down with Gary Vaynerchuk. I worked for Gary for a couple of years. Then I shared with him that I was considering not only building my own consulting firm, but starting to put out content to help people build their personal brand, but then also drive awareness and conversion to my business. His response shocked me. This is the man that preaches online 24-7, everyone needs to be making content. Content is the gateway drug to what you want out of life. That's like his direct quote. What he said to me is, I really think you should be sure that this is what you really want. You might be able to build a great business without ever making content. I want you to make sure that this fits into the life that you are building. As you can imagine, sitting down with the content king, hearing something like that, it caused me to think twice. I really tried to look at what am I trying to accomplish? Is making content publicly, is this necessary to accomplish that? What I realized is that I had two main goals.",
