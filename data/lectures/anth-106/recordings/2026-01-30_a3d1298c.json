  "transcript": "All right, so let me tell you something interesting, and I promise this actually has to do with the video. I was reading a few weeks ago, NASA spends about four and a half billion dollars a year on space operations. And a really big slice of that pie is literally to figure out how to transform regular people into superhuman performers. So they spend about $15 million per year individually on an astronaut. And as they were going through this whole process, they figured out one protocol that changes everything. One that you can actually apply in your 2026 to achieve every single goal that you might have for the year. Here's the protocol. You know what NASA does with an astronaut before a mission? Immersion phase. Complete isolation. Zero contact with the outside world. No family.",
