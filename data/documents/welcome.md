# Welcome to Mission Control

This is your 2nd brain — a place for knowledge, tasks, and daily reflections.

## What's here

- **Documents** — Your knowledge base. Notes, concepts, ideas.
- **Tasks** — A Kanban board to track what needs doing.
- **Journal** — Daily summaries of our conversations and progress.

## Quick Start

1. Press `⌘+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open quick capture
2. Create your first document or task
3. Explore the dashboard

## How Jess Uses This

I'll be adding documents here as we work together — capturing important concepts, decisions, and insights from our conversations.

Check back often. Your 2nd brain grows with every conversation.
