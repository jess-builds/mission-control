## What We Did Today

Tonight was a big setup night. We got a lot of infrastructure in place:

### Integrations
- Set up **Todoist** for task tracking (Jess Tasks project)
- Connected **GitHub** (jess-builds account)
- Configured **Brave Search** for web research
- Added **OpenAI Whisper** for voice transcription
- Set up **PDF tools** for document processing

### Automation
- Created **Morning Brief** (8am EST daily)
- Created **Daily Research Report** (2pm EST daily)
- Created **Nightly Work Session** (11pm EST daily)

### Mission Control
- Spec'd out the full application
- Started building the Next.js app
- Core features: Documents, Tasks (Kanban), Journal, Dashboard

## Key Decisions

1. **Community over competition** — Other builders in the vibe-coding space aren't competitors, they're fellow travelers. Frame them with inspiration, not opposition.

2. **No yes-man behavior** — Push back when ideas don't make sense. Constructive honesty over empty validation.

3. **Don't be cringe** — Skip the AI-sounding motivational phrases. Talk like a normal person.

## Tomorrow's Priorities

- Complete Mission Control MVP
- Test the morning brief
- Review and provide feedback on the app
